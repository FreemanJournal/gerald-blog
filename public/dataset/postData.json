        "description": "Even though I didn't work at GitHub when they announced Copilot, I remember it piqued my interest. Perhaps, I was mostly excited because it was new and shiny.(Also, because I love predictive text in other environments like writing emails, why not in my code editor?) When I received access to the feature, I realized two things:It’s not magic. GitHub Copilot can’t read my mind, and it will not always spit out perfectly well-written, up-to-date code.It’s not magic. GitHub Copilot can’t read my mind, and it will not always spit out perfectly well-written, up-to-date code.Copilot increases my confidence and velocity as a programmer.For me, the value of Copilot is that I spend less time stressing over syntax, which leaves more time for solving problems.",

I agree with the premise of your argument - that time doesn't necessarily equate to experience, but my consensus tends to focus on the C-players rather than the A-players. C-players may have 5 years working at a company, but if they haven't grown their skillset, their 'experience' is likely more on par with junior level engineers than a mid or senior.",
